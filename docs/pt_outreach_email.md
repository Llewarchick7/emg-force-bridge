Subject: Quick demo of low-cost EMG feedback device for PTs — 10–15 min?

Hi [Name],

I'm building a low-cost EMG-based feedback prototype (Arduino + MyoWare) to help physical therapists visualize and train muscle activation. I'm looking for 1–2 clinics to run short demos and collect feedback.

Would you be open to a 10–15 minute in-clinic demo? I bring the kit and materials; we only need a willing subject for brief contractions. I'll bring a consent form and de-identified data capture.

Thanks,
